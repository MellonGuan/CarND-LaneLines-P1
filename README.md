# CarND-LaneLines-P1
# **Overview Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
---
MY First Project in Udacity
The goals of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline.

My pipeline consisted of 3 steps:
**Step 1:**, I converted the images to grayscale, and I Use Gaussian smoothing filtering, and I use Canny Edge Detect Lane Lines

**Step 2:**, I use a quadrilateral region mask to filter out detected line segments in image.

**Step 3:**, Use Hough Transform to Find Lane Lines on Edge Detected Image

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

One potential shortcoming would be what use the extrapolation technique to calculate the slopes as a guide for extrapolation to get the solid lines on the lane. because, I can't understand, So I can't calculation in current pipeline.

### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

If you help me to understand calculate function. May be possible improvement
